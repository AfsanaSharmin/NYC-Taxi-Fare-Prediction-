# NYC-Taxi-Fare-Prediction-

This project investigates taxi fare prediction using machine learning and deep learning techniques on the NYC Taxi Trip Data - Google Public Data(2022). The study follows an end-to-end data science pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation. Multiple models—Linear Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, and a Feedforward Neural Network—are trained and compared using regression metrics such as R², RMSE, MAE, and MSE. Results show that CatBoost achieves the best predictive performance, effectively capturing non-linear relationships in fare dynamics. Additionally, spatio-temporal clustering (DBSCAN) is used to identify high-demand zones and fare trends, providing insights into urban mobility patterns in New York City.
